# Challenge 07 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler App


## Description

For this project it was asked to create a simple calendar application (using jQuery and Moment.js) that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day.

The app needed to check for the following: 
* Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
* Persist events between refreshes of a page.
## Usage

The following animation shows the application's functionality:
